# Dear fellow traveler

Welcome. I am Patrick Faion, a student of Cognitive Science and passionate programmer. This site is a work-in-progress project, designed to act as an information hub, notebook and also portfolio for myself.

Here you will find strange ideas that crossed my mind and that I felt are worth writing down, projects that I am currently working on as well as project ideas I haven't had the time to start with.
